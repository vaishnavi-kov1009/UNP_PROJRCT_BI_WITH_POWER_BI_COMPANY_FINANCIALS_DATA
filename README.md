# UNP_PROJRCT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA

 A Power BI company financials report provides an interactive and visual representation of a company’s financial performance, enabling better decision-making. It typically includes key financial statements such as the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The Revenue & Profitability Dashboard tracks total revenue, gross profit, net profit, and profit margins, while an Expense Analysis Dashboard breaks down operating expenses, cost of goods sold (COGS), and other financial obligations. Trend analysis using Power BI's visualization tools, such as line charts and bar graphs, helps in understanding revenue growth, cost fluctuations, and profitability trends over time.
Additionally, the Financial Ratios & Performance Dashboard includes critical metrics like current ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, return on equity (ROE), and earnings per share (EPS) to assess liquidity, solvency, and profitability. A Cash Flow Dashboard helps track operating, investing, and financing cash flows, providing insights into cash generation and usage. Power BI’s forecasting and AI-driven analytics can predict future financial performance, enabling strategic planning. With interactive filters and drill-down features, stakeholders can analyze financial data in-depth, identify trends, and make data-driven business decisions efficiently.
